# Fake-News-Detection System

The software for the product is divided into two major components. 
The first component consists of the Fake News Detection Model which contains the python notebooks used to build, evaluate, and save the model. 
The second component consists of the User interface built using Flask (Python) as the backend and VueJS as the frontend for deploying the model and allowing the user to verify the credibility of a Reddit news post.
